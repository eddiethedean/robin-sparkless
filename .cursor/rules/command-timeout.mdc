# Command Timeout

When running terminal commands, use a timeout of at least **600000ms (10 minutes)** for commands that may run a long time, such as:

- `make check-full` or `make check`
- `cargo test` (full suite)
- Any test or build command that might take > 30 seconds

The default 30-second timeout can cause useful commands to be killed. Use **`timeout: 600000`** by default for `make check-full` and similar full-check commands; use `timeout: 180000` or higher for other long-running test/build commands as needed.
