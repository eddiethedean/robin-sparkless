# Command Timeout

When running terminal commands, use a timeout of at least **180000ms (3 minutes)** for commands that may run a long time, such as:

- `make check-full` or `make check`
- `cargo test` (full suite)
- Any test or build command that might take > 30 seconds

The default 30-second timeout can cause useful commands to be killed. Use `timeout: 180000` or higher (up to 600000ms) for these cases.
